# About This Project:
This project is to build a deep learning model using Encoder-Decoder structure to perform machine translation from English to Arabic. The model will be based on Sequence to Sequence (seq2seq) models, a special class of Recurrent Neural Network architectures where two long-term-short-memory(LSTM) will be coupled to create a translation model.
